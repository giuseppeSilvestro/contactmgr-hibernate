# contactmgr-hibernate

In this project we are going to explore Hibernate. 
The project will be about creating an app to manage contacts and save them in a database.
In the initial commit we set up the project adding two dependencies to the build.gradle file: Hibernate and H2.
We also created a new file in the resources folder called 'hibernate.cfg.xml' where we configured Hibernate to work with H2 database.
